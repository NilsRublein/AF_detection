# Automatic Detection of Atrial Fribrilation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication occurring postoperatively from cardiac surgery. It is often asymptomatic and occurs periodically which makes it hard to be detected. The ECG monitoring necessary for this detection is done manually which is time-consuming and therefore very costly. 
As part of the data science course at the University of Twente, me and Vera Dierx wrote a paper that was set out to answer the question to what extent AF can be detected automatically. In the paper we discuss balancing of data, feature extraction & selection, and compare various classifiers inlcuding for example support vector machines and random forest trees.

This repository contains the report and the accompanying Python code and data set.
